### Hi there 👋
I'm Juan Antonio López, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Universidad Austral de Chile. I'm passionate about creating meaningful solutions through software, and currently looking for opportunities to grow as a developer and contribute to impactful projects.

Here’s a bit more about me:

🎓 I recently finished my degree and developed a full Progressive Web App as my thesis using ReactJS, NodeJS, and PostgreSQL.

💻 I'm especially interested in software development, data science, digital transformation, and project management.

🌱 Currently exploring topics like Power BI, SQL, and advanced JavaScript frameworks.

🤝 Always open to collaborating with other developers or learning from new challenges.
