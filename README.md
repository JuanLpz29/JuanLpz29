### Hi there 👋
My name is Juan Antonio López. I'm on my last year of computer science civil engineering at Universidad Austral de Chile and I'm looking for a job right now. 

I really hope i can help you with something or maybe you can help me! Please don't hesitate and contact me if you need anything. Here is a little more about my current studies and work:

- 🔭 I did my thesis work on a progressive web application built with ReactJS and nodeJS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, HTML, CSS, among other tools and languages.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other developers for further dev works. I would like to learn about data science with Power BI and Power Pivot aswell.
- 📫 How to reach me: Add me on Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanlpzm/ or just send me an e-mail to juanlpz29@outlook.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I wanted to do this section in two languages (also spanish) but i think english fits better here by itself.
