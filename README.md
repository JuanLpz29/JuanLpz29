### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Juan Antonio LÃ³pez. I'm on my last year of computer science civil engineering at Universidad Austral de Chile. Im looking for a good and interesting topic for my thesis work. Something fun like Data Science or Cibersecurity will do. 

I really hope i can help you with something or maybe you can help me! Please don't hesitate and contact me if you need anything. Here is a little more about my current studies and work:


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently doing my professional practice working with Macro programming in Excel at Grupo Saesa in the R&D area.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning VBA and other advanced Excel features.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Data Science Projects or something related to Databases Analytics. I would like to learn Power BI and Power Pivot aswell.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Add me on Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanlpzm/ or just send me an e-mail juanlpz29@outlook.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I wanted to do this section in two languages (also spanish) but i think english fits better here by itself.
